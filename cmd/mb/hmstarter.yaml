    # About Chris Foster and Eastside Emerald Home Repair
    
    My name is Chris and I've been a general contractor and auto mechanic 
    since I was a kid. My father owned rental properties and taught me how to
    fix pretty much anything, from installing toilets, lighting, outlet, and water heaters to
    fixing drywall, doing ductwork, and adding on rooms. I was also a certified
    Ford mechanic for a decade, investing $50,000 on tools and more on training.

    **Fixing things in houses is usually pretty easy** for me, because I had to
    do all those same tasks fixing advanced engines. It turns out that the principles
    of electricity and fluid mechanics are the same whether you're dealing with a
    leaky water heater or fixing the transmission on a $1 million Ford GT. But
    cars contain thousands of parts in a very confined space and require immense precision. 
    Fixing things around the house is a lot less challenging.
