# To do

## Priority 1: Showstoppers--required for the next release

## Priority 2: Desired but not required for the next release

* Make `/docs directory` configurable
* Write tests for slice pkg
* Support for TOML front matter. See pkg/mdedxt/tomltc.go.sav and 
[Reddit RFP for TOML](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/pthh4p/paying_gig_for_foss_project_extending_the/)
* Ability to handle links with `.md` files instead of `.html`,
e.g. instead of

`[To do](todo.html)`

the markup would be:

`[To do](todo.md)`
