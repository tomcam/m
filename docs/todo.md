# To do

## Priority 1: Showstoppers--required for the next release

## Priority 2: Desired but not required for the next release

* Create a test case for each error code
* Make `/docs directory` configurable
* Change QuitError to take only the error number for clarity
* Write tests for slice pkg
* Support for TOML front matter. See pkg/mdedxt/tomltc.go.sav and 
[Reddit RFP for TOML](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/pthh4p/paying_gig_for_foss_project_extending_the/)
* Ability to handle links with `.md` files instead of `.html`,
e.g. instead of

`[To do](todo.html)`

the markup would be:

`[To do](todo.md)`

* Investigate speed of converting byte array to string. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40632802/how-to-convert-byte-array-to-string-in-go . Important in code like this: 

```
fmt.Println(string(mdFileToHTML(filename)))
```
