# 0954

## Error message: Duplicate path for collection. 

Starter file /Users/tom/code/m/cmd/mb/badstart.yaml already has a collection named /blog/ (error code mbz0953)

## How you got here

The site already has a collection by a specified name.
Suppose you have a starter file with the following contents:


```
blog:
  Type: collection 
  
/blog/:year/:month/:datenum/:
  Type: collection
```

This is may not appear to be an error but it is. Imagine running this on the command line:

```
mb new post /blog
```

Assuming the collection was already defined somewhere it will be stored
in the `Collections` portion of your site configuration file in either case 
using the key `/blog/`. Because the post generated will actually end up 
with a full pathname looking something like `/blog/2022/February/21`


## What to do about it

You'll need to start the key with a new directory path that doesn't interfere. For example:


```
blog:
  Type: collection 
  
finance/blog/:year/:month/:datenum/:
  Type: collection
```
