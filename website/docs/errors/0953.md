## Error message: There is already a directory named

## How you got here

While trying to create a posts directory, Metabuzz found an
existing posts directory by that same name.

## What to do about it

One likely cause is a starter file that cut and pasted the same
name, like this:
```
blog:
  Type: posts
  Folder: /blog

# Then, later in the file (note the folder name was 
# copy/pasted by accident)
news:
  Type: posts
  Folder: /blog
```
