## Error message: Error creating directory for starter

## How you got here

A bad directory was specified in a starter file.

## What to do about it

The directory may be an illegal name, or you
may not have permissions for that path. Try simplifying
the name. Remember that the directory is treated
as a subdirectory of the project.
