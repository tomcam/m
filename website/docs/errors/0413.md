## Error message: Error creating temporary site directory for project

## How you got here

This error occurred with the `new site` command. 
When Metabuzz creates a new site it does so in a temporary directory. 
Only when that process is complete does it change the name of the directory to the
one you specified. This error occurs in the (presumably very rare) case
where Metabuzz couldn't finish the process. The temporary directory
itself should be deleted no matter what.

## What to do about it

See if you have a disk full condition or permission to create in
the specified directory.
