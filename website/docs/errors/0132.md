## Error message: Unable to open theme configuration file 

## How you got here
You were attempting to create a new theme from an existing one but Metabuzz
can't find the source theme. 

## What to do about it

The metabuzz syntax to create a new theme is:

```
mb new {source theme} {destination theme}
```

Where  `{source theme}` is an existing Metabuzz theme such as 
`wide` and `{destination theme}` is the name of the theme
you'd like to create from it.

For example:

```
mb new theme widex foo
```

This command means "create the theme named foo from the existing theme
named widex".

In this example there is no Metabuzz theme named `widex`. It probably
means that you mistyped the theme name. Or you may have reversed the
source and destination theme names. Perhaps you typed

```
mb new theme foo wide
```

When you meant to type

```
mb new theme wide foo
```

Double-check your themes directory and make sure you typed the
source name right.
