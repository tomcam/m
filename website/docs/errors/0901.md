## Error message: Unable to allocate Site object

## How you got here

You probably got here because you tried to build a project
by specifying a directory that Metabuzz can't get to. 
It might not exist at all, or it may be you're using
a directory designation Metabuzz doesn't support.
For example, if you're on a Mac or Linux system and 
do something like this, it won't work because shortcuts
like `~` or `../` are converted into filepaths by the shell, 
(this is called shell expansion) and Metabuzz doesn't do
shell expansion.

```
:: Fails even if you have a project at ~/myproject
mb build ~/myproject
```

## What to do about it

Make sure the directory exists, or change to it and issue the `build`
command.

```
cd ~/myproject 
mb build
```
