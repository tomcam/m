## Error message: Can't find the site

## How you got here

You requested information for a site that doesn't exist. For example, 
you would get this error if you entered the command

```
$ mb info site asdfasdfasdf
```

Because there is no site directory named, asdfasdfasdf, unless you're mental or just
downright ornery.

## What to do about it

Double-check the name of the site you specified.
