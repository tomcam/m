# 1028

## Error message: XXX Can't find a theme named

## How you got here

You specified a theme but there's no theme by that name. Example:

##### filename: **index.md**
```
---
Theme: pilar
---
hello, world.
```

The example file listing above would fail because there's no theme
called `pilar` (it's a mistyped version of the Metabuzz `pillar` theme,
which does exist). It would result in an error message like this:

```
/Users/rajiv/myblog/index.md: Can't find a theme named gallery (expected in /Users/rajiv/myblog/.mb/themes/pilar) (error code mbz1028)
```

The Markdown source file is at `/Users/rajiv/myblog/index.md`. Since
it specifies the theme name `pilar` this error message shows where the
directory with the `pilar` theme files should be.

## What to do about it

Double-check the theme name.
