## Error message: This isn't a project directory

## How you got here

If you're creating a theme like this:

```
mb new theme
```

You'll get this error if you are not currently in a Metabuzz project directory.

## What to do about it

Either change to a project directory or make the current directory a project:

```
mb new site
```
