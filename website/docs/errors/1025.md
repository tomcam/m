## Error message: This isn't a project directory

## How you got here

If you're creating a theme like this:

```
mb new theme
```

You'll get this error if you are not currently in a Metabuzz project directory.

## What to do about it

Either change to a project directory or make the current directory a project:

```
mb new site
```

## Sure but why do I have to create a them inside a project directory? Can't a theme be independent of a project? I might want to use it in several different projects?
It may be good to relax this restriction later. Here's why it works that way right now.

The current design of Metabuzz is that when you create a theme it's probably for a new website, and putting themes inside the `.mb` directory 
makes them easier to discover and to edit. Then when you've finished the design and want it to be available to other projects, you 
explicitly copy it into the Metabuzz application directory. Allowing the creation of global themes with `.mb new theme` would either
require that each time it runs you're asked whether it's a local or global theme. That would be confusing to some people, who would
put the theme in the wrong place and wonder why they can't find it.
