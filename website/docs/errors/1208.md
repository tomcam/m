# 1208

## Error message: Your path must start with a normal directory name, for example, `blog` or `news`

## How you got here

Inside a starter file you specified something like this:

```
:year/:monthnum/:datenum/blog:
  Type: collection 
```


## What to do about it

It won't work because if you try a `new post` command like this, Metabuzz can't figure out where to put it:

```
mb new post /blog "New version"
```
You would want to change the permalink to look like this:

```
/blog/:year/:monthnum/:datenum/
  Type: collection 
```
