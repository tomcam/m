## Error message: Can't change to site directory

## How you got here


You are running Metabuzz from the command line and
it was invoked something like this, where `html/foo` is the
suposed path to a project directory:

```
mb build html/foo
```

This error occurs when no such project directory exists,
or you don't have permissions to open it.


## What to do about it

Make sure you got the directory designation correct.
