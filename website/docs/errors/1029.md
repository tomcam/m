## Error message: Can't find the theme file

## How you got here

Each theme directory has files such as 'reset.css', 'layout.css', and so forth.
The way Metabuzz determines whether to copy those out when publishing a site
is to look in a file by the same name as the theme. For example, you 
might have a theme named Debut, so Metabuzz expects to find a themes
directory named 'debut' and, inside that directory, a file named
`debut.yaml`.

## What to do about it

A likely reason for that is that you created a child theme by from scratch and
forgot to rename the configuration file to the child theme name. For example,
you wanted to create a child theme called Marquee from the Debut theme. If you 
just copied from the Debut parent directory the Marquee directory will still
have a configuration file called `debut.yaml` when instead it should be
`marqee.yaml`.

Or: The theme seems to be missing its most important file. Or perhaps you simply mistyped the theme name.
