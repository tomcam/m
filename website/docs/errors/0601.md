## Error message: System error attempting to delete temporary site directory

## How you got here

This happened during the creation of a new site.
Metabuzz first generates a temporary directory to hold the files
required to populate a site directory. After that's complete, it
renames the temporary directory. But suppose it wasn't
possible to generate the temporary version of the site?
Those files need to be deleted.

This error occurred 
when Metabuzz tried to delete the temporary directory or some of
its contents, an error occured.

## What to do about it

Try again maybe? File a bug if this happens again because it should
be extremely rare and needs to be looked into by us.
