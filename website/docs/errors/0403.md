## Error message: Unable to create publish directory

## How you got here

Metabuzz generates HTML files from your Markdown source files.
It copies the output HTML files to the publish directory.
To ensure consistent site, the publish directory 
gets deleted, then recreated just before the
published output is copied there. For some reason 
the latter step (creating the publish directory)
isn't possible.

This is an internal error and I genuinely hope you don't
encounter it.

## What to do about it

Ugh. Log out, then log back in, I guess.
