 Theme configuration file /Users/tom/code/m/cmd/mb/foo/.mb/themes/hero/home/home.yamlspecifies a file named reset.css, which can't be found. (error code mbz1027)

## Error message: Theme configuration file specifieds a file which can't be found

## How you got here

The theme configuration file, *themename*.yaml (where you'd replace *themename* with
the actual name of the theme, which is also its directory name, specified a
file that's missing from the theme directory.

One common cause of this is when you're missing one of these files:

* `sidebar-right.css` 
* `sidebar-left.css` 
* `theme-light.css` 
* `theme-dark.css` 
* `responsive.css`
* `reset.css`

This could easily happen if you created a nested theme, and forgot to include one 
or more of these files, then specified something
in the front matter that triggers a need for one of them. For example, if you didn't
include the sidebar files and the site configuration file or the front matter
specified something like `Sidebar: right`.

## What to do about it

Copy the needed file, possibly from a parent theme. Or remove its name 
from the theme configuration file
