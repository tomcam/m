# 1101

## Error message: Unable to chdir: no such file or directory 

## How you got here

A directory was specified for the build command and it's not available.
Normally you run `mb build` with no arguments because you want
to build the project in the current directory. You can specify a directory,
in which case Metabuzz will change to that directory and build the
project there.

#### Example: The directory manuall was misspelled as manuall

```
:: In this example there is no directory named manuall
mb build manuall
```

## What to do about it

Make sure the directory exists, or that Metabuzz has proper file system permissions to 
create files in that directory.
