# 0135

## Error message: Error in starter file 

## How you got here

A starter YAML file is internally inconsistent. For example, the error
might appear something like this:

```
YAML error in file badstart.yaml: yaml: unmarshal errors:
line 4: mapping key "blog" already defined at line 1 (error code mbz0135)
```

## What to do about it

The obvious thing to do is to open the file named 
in the error message and look at the line it mentions.

For example, perhaps someone accidentally gave two collections
names that resolve to the same path, like this:

```
/blog:
  Type: collection 

/site/news/:year/:month
  Type: collection

blog:
  Type: collection
```

Metabuzz normalizes the filenames in the keys above, so `/blog` and `blog` will
both resolve to `/blog`.
