## Error message: System error changing to newly create site directory

## How you got here

When you issued the `new site` command the last thing Metabuzz does is change
to the directory specified by that command. There was an internal system
error because Metabuzz failed to change to the directory.

## What to do about it

Make sure you specified a pathname ending in a name with no spaces or other special characters in it.
