# 1102

## Error message: This isn't a directory 

## How you got here

`mb build` is run but it's not in a valid project 
directory.  Run `mb new site` first.

The `build` command creates a new `.mb` directory and
copies all results of the build into that directory.
This error occurs when Metabuzz can't find a site
file inside an `.mb` directory.

## What to do about it

Run `mb new site`, as shown:

```
: Replace myexample with the name of your
: project. It should include no spaces.
$ mb new site myexample
```
